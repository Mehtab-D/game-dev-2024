        In programming, an object is like a container that holds related information and actions.It is like a way to organize data and functions that belong together. For example, a car object might have data like its make, model, and color, and actions like starting the engine.
        Objects help you manage complex systems by keeping related things together in one place. An array is a way to store multiple values in a single variable. Itâ€™s like a list where you can keep items in a specific order. Each item in an array is called an element, and you can access them using their position, called an index.Arrays keep things organized and they make it easy to work with multiple things at once.
